## Core Concepts

### What is Chain of Draft?
Chain of Draft (CoD) is an innovative prompt engineering technique that revolutionizes how language models approach reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, CoD enforces brevity and precision by limiting each reasoning step to five words or less.

### Origins and Motivation
- **Problem**: Traditional CoT prompting generates verbose outputs with thousands of tokens
- **Inspiration**: Human cognitive processes - we think in brief, essential points
- **Goal**: Reduce token usage while maintaining or improving reasoning quality

### Fundamental Principles
1. **Brevity**: Five-word limit per reasoning step
2. **Sequential Thinking**: Structured step-by-step approach
3. **Essential Information**: Focus on key points only
4. **Natural Cognition**: Mirrors human thought patterns
5. **Efficiency**: Minimizes token usage and processing time

## Implementation Guide

### Basic Structure
```
Input: [Problem statement]
Draft 1: [First key point ≤5 words]
Draft 2: [Second key point ≤5 words]
Draft 3: [Third key point ≤5 words]
...
Final Answer: [Conclusion based on drafts]
```

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. **Draft Writing Guidelines**
   - Use precise, concrete language
   - Focus on one concept per draft
   - Maintain logical progression
   - Ensure each draft adds value
   - Connect drafts to final answer

2. **Problem Types and Adaptations**
   - Mathematical reasoning
   - Logical deduction
   - Analysis and evaluation
   - Decision-making tasks
   - Complex problem decomposition

3. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
   - Exceeding word limit
   - Skipping logical steps
   - Redundant drafts
   - Unclear connections
   - Incomplete reasoning

### Example Implementation

```python
from promptchain import PromptEngineer

class ChainOfDraftPrompt:
    def __init__(self):
        self.template = """
        Use Chain of Draft to solve this problem.
        Rules:
        - Each draft must be 5 words or less
        - Think step by step
        - Show clear reasoning progression
        
        Problem: {problem}
        
        {few_shot_examples}
        
        Now solve:
        Draft 1:
        Draft 2:
        Draft 3:
        Final Answer:
        """
        
    def generate_prompt(self, problem, examples=None):
        return self.template.format(
            problem=problem,
            few_shot_examples=self._format_examples(examples)
        )

# Usage example
cod = ChainOfDraftPrompt()
engineer = PromptEngineer(
    techniques=["chain_of_draft"],
    model_config={
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "max_tokens": 1000
    }
)
```
