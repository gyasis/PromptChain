# Ingestors and Multimodal Processing

## Ingestors Overview

The PromptChain project includes a collection of specialized ingestors for handling different types of content sources. These ingestors provide standardized interfaces for extracting and processing content from various data sources.

### Ingestor Types

1. **ArxivProcessor** (`ingestors/arxiv.py`)
   - Processes arXiv papers by extracting identifiers from URLs
   - Downloads PDFs and converts them to Markdown format for further processing
   - Provides access to paper abstracts and metadata
   - Uses `pymupdf4llm` for PDF processing

2. **CustomCrawler** (`ingestors/crawler.py`)
   - Web crawler for extracting content from general websites
   - Supports both single-page and multi-page crawling
   - Handles URL normalization and content extraction
   - Uses `crawl4ai` for efficient asynchronous crawling

3. **ContentExtractor** (`ingestors/marktechpost.py`)
   - Specializes in extracting content from technical blog posts
   - Converts HTML to Markdown format
   - Can create PDFs from webpage content
   - Specifically optimized for technical content sites like MarkTechPost

4. **SinglePage Advanced** (`ingestors/singlepage_advanced.py`)
   - Enhanced single-page crawler with JavaScript execution capabilities
   - Supports image conversion to base64 for multimodal processing
   - Handles "Load More" buttons and dynamic content
   - Includes token counting for LLM context management

5. **YouTubeSubtitlesProcessor** (`ingestors/youtube_subtitles_processor/`)
   - Extracts and processes subtitles from YouTube videos
   - Cleans up formatting, removes tags, and merges short lines
   - Supports automatic subtitle download
   - Combines with multimodal processing for full video analysis

## Multimodal Ingesting

The `multimodal_ingest.py` file implements comprehensive multimodal content ingestion with LiteLLM integration. This system provides:

### Key Capabilities

1. **Input Type Detection**
   - Automatically detects various input types (URLs, local files, specific platforms)
   - Identifies YouTube videos, arXiv papers, general webpages
   - Detects local media files (video, audio, PDF)

2. **Platform-Specific Processing**
   - YouTube: Extracts subtitles and optionally processes video content
   - arXiv: Downloads and processes academic papers
   - Webpages: Extracts and formats content for LLM processing

3. **Media Processing**
   - Uses Gemini models for processing visual content in videos
   - Analyzes images and videos for visual elements, gestures, and context
   - Combines transcript and visual analysis for comprehensive understanding

4. **Integration with PromptChain**
   - Feeds processed content into PromptChain for analysis
   - Uses specialized prompts for different content types
   - Allows for customized analysis of various media types

### GeminiMultimedia Integration

The `extras/gemini_multimedia.py` module provides:

1. **Multimedia Processing**
   - Handles images, audio, and video files
   - Integrates with Google's Gemini Pro Vision API
   - Supports various media formats with automatic MIME type detection

2. **Model Selection**
   - Automatically selects appropriate models based on content type
   - Supports vision models for images
   - Uses advanced models for audio and video processing

3. **Technical Features**
   - Automatic resource cleanup
   - Format validation for supported media types
   - Temporary file management for processing

- ‚ùå Batch processing capabilities
- ‚ùå Content chunking for very large files
- ‚ùå Model caching to improve performance
- ‚ùå Expanded LiteLLM integration options

## Usage Patterns

The MultimodalIngestor class provides a unified interface:

```python
# Example usage
async def process_content():
    ingestor = MultimodalIngestor()
    
    # Process different content types with the same interface
    youtube_content = await ingestor.process_input(
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example",
        media_prompt="Analyze the visual elements in this video",
        analysis_prompt="Summarize the key points about AI",
        download_video=True
    )
    
    arxiv_content = await ingestor.process_input(
        "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345",
        analysis_prompt="Extract the methodology and results"
    )
    
    # Process local media files
    image_analysis = await ingestor.process_input(
        "path/to/image.jpg",
        media_prompt="Describe this image in detail"
    )
```

## Integration with PromptChain

The multimodal ingestors integrate with PromptChain to enable specialized prompt creation based on content:

1. Extract content using appropriate ingestor
2. Process multimedia elements when present
3. Feed the processed content into PromptChain
4. Apply specialized analysis prompts based on content type
5. Generate comprehensive understanding by combining textual and visual elements
