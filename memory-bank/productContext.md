# Product Context: PromptChain

## Why PromptChain Exists

PromptChain was created to address key challenges in prompt engineering for modern LLM applications:

1. **Prompt Complexity Management**: As LLM applications become more sophisticated, prompts grow increasingly complex and difficult to manage. PromptChain provides a structured way to build, refine, and test prompts systematically.

2. **Cross-Model Optimization**: Different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) respond differently to the same prompts. PromptChain enables sequential refinement across multiple models to leverage their unique strengths.

3. **Agent Framework Complexity**: Agent frameworks like AutoGen, LangChain, and CrewAI each have their own requirements for prompts. PromptChain specializes prompts for these frameworks while maintaining a consistent development approach.

4. **Lack of Systematic Tools**: Traditional prompt engineering often relies on ad-hoc methods. PromptChain introduces a systematic approach with history tracking, function injection, and conditional processing.

## Problems PromptChain Solves

### For Developers
- **Prompt Refinement Complexity**: Eliminates the need for manual prompt iteration by providing a structured chain of refinement steps
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility**: Solves the challenge of adapting prompts for different agent frameworks
- **Reproducibility Issues**: Addresses inconsistency in prompt engineering by tracking history and enabling systematic approaches
- **Integration Complexity**: Simplifies the inclusion of custom processing functions between LLM calls

### For Organizations
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces costs by optimizing prompts before deployment at scale
- **Knowledge Capture**: Preserves prompt engineering knowledge in structured chains rather than scattered experiments
- **Quality Consistency**: Ensures consistent prompt quality across different applications and teams
- **Skill Leverage**: Allows prompt engineering expertise to be codified and shared across teams

## How PromptChain Works

### Core Workflow
1. **Chain Definition**: 
   - Define a sequence of instructions (prompts or functions)
   - Specify which LLM to use for each prompt instruction
   - Set configuration options (history tracking, verbose output, etc.)

2. **Processing Flow**:
   - Initial input is passed to the first instruction
   - Output flows through each step in the chain
   - Each step can be an LLM call or a custom processing function
   - Results can feed forward with or without full history context

3. **Integration Pattern**:
   - Generate specialized prompts through chains
   - Inject these optimized prompts into agent frameworks
   - Dynamically adapt prompts based on changing contexts

### User Experience Goals
- **Developer-Friendly API**: Simple interface that abstracts complexity
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adaptable to various use cases without code changes
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear visibility into each step of prompt processing
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration of custom functions and models
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Focus on core functionality with limited external requirements

## Target Users

### Primary
- **Prompt Engineers**: Professionals focused on optimizing LLM interactions
- **AI Application Developers**: Engineers building LLM-powered applications
- **Agent Framework Users**: Developers working with AutoGen, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.

### Secondary
