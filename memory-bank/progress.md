## Current Status

The project is in an early but functional state. The core PromptChain class is implemented and works for basic prompt chaining with multiple models and function injection. Environment setup is working correctly, and the project structure is established.

Basic ingestors and multimodal processing capabilities are in place, particularly for YouTube videos, arXiv papers, and general web content. Integration with Google's Gemini API provides multimodal analysis capabilities.

Development focus is currently on:
1. Enhancing the robustness of the core implementation
2. Creating examples for integration with agent frameworks
3. Building out documentation and tests
4. Planning advanced features for chain composition and management
5. Improving multimodal processing and integration with LiteLLM

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for API failures, needs more robust recovery mechanisms
2. **Memory Management**: Potential memory issues with very long chains when using full history tracking
3. **Rate Limiting**: No built-in handling for provider rate limits
4. **Environment Configuration**: Environment variable loading path may cause issues in certain deployments
5. **Media Processing**: Large media files may exceed token limits or cause performance issues

### Documentation Issues
1. **API Reference**: Incomplete documentation of all parameters and return values
2. **Examples**: Limited examples for advanced usage patterns
3. **Integration Guides**: Missing detailed guides for framework integration
4. **Multimodal Documentation**: Insufficient examples for multimodal processing workflows

### Future Compatibility
1. **Provider Changes**: Risk of breaking changes from LLM providers 
2. **LiteLLM Dependencies**: Reliance on LiteLLM for provider abstraction introduces dependency risks
3. **Gemini API Changes**: Updates to the Gemini API could impact multimodal processing
