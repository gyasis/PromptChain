## Current Status

The project is in an early but functional state. The core PromptChain class is implemented and works for basic prompt chaining with multiple models and function injection. Environment setup is working correctly, and the project structure is established.

Basic ingestors and multimodal processing capabilities are in place, particularly for YouTube videos, arXiv papers, and general web content. Integration with Google's Gemini API provides multimodal analysis capabilities.

The Memory Bank feature is now fully implemented, providing persistent storage capabilities across chain executions, allowing chains to maintain state and share information. The implementation includes namespace organization, memory operations (store, retrieve, check, list, clear), and specialized memory functions and chains.

The AgenticStepProcessor now works correctly with integrated tools, including proper function name extraction from different tool call formats. This allows for sophisticated agentic behaviors within a single chain step, with the ability to make multiple LLM calls and tool invocations to achieve a defined objective.

Development focus is currently on:
1. Enhancing the robustness of the core implementation
2. Creating examples for integration with agent frameworks
3. Building out documentation and tests
4. Planning advanced features for chain composition and management
5. Improving multimodal processing and integration with LiteLLM
6. Extending Memory Bank with persistent storage options
7. Refining tool integration and agentic processing

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for API failures, needs more robust recovery mechanisms
2. **Memory Management**: Potential memory issues with very long chains when using full history tracking
3. **Rate Limiting**: No built-in handling for provider rate limits
4. **Environment Configuration**: Environment variable loading path may cause issues in certain deployments
5. **Media Processing**: Large media files may exceed token limits or cause performance issues

### Documentation Issues
1. **API Reference**: Incomplete documentation of all parameters and return values
2. **Examples**: Limited examples for advanced usage patterns
3. **Integration Guides**: Missing detailed guides for framework integration
4. **Multimodal Documentation**: Insufficient examples for multimodal processing workflows

### Future Compatibility
1. **Provider Changes**: Risk of breaking changes from LLM providers
2. **LiteLLM Dependencies**: Reliance on LiteLLM for provider abstraction introduces dependency risks
3. **Gemini API Changes**: Updates to the Gemini API could impact multimodal processing

## Recent Refactoring Progress & Issues

- :white_check_mark: **Memory Bank Functions Removed:** Successfully removed `store_memory`, `retrieve_memory`, and related functions from `promptchaining.py`.
- :white_check_mark: **AgenticStepProcessor Extended:** Introduced AgenticStepProcessor class in agentic_step_processor.py to enable internal agentic loops within a step. Now accepts an optional model_name parameter. If set, the agentic step uses this model for LLM calls; if not, it defaults to the first model in the PromptChain's models list. llm_runner_callback in PromptChain updated to support this logic, ensuring backward compatibility and flexibility.
- :white_check_mark: **Function Name Extraction Fixed:** Added robust `get_function_name_from_tool_call` function that can extract function names from various tool call formats (dict, object, nested structures). This resolves the infinite loop issues with tool execution.
- :white_check_mark: **Tool Execution Improved:** Fixed the tool execution logic in both the AgenticStepProcessor and PromptChain to properly handle different tool call formats and extract function names and arguments reliably.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: **MCP Logic Moved:** Moved MCP execution logic to `mcp_client_manager.py`.
- :white_check_mark: **Context7 Integration:** Successfully integrated Context7 MCP tools for accessing up-to-date library documentation.
- :white_check_mark: **Sequential Thinking Tool:** Added support for the sequential thinking MCP tool to help with complex reasoning tasks.
