# Project Brief: PromptChain

## Project Definition
PromptChain is a flexible prompt engineering library designed to create, refine, and specialize prompts for LLM applications and agent frameworks. It enables the creation of sophisticated prompt chains that can combine multiple LLMs and processing functions into coherent workflows.

## Core Goals
1. Provide a flexible system for creating and refining complex prompts across multiple models
2. Enable prompt specialization for various agent frameworks (AutoGen, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
3. Support function injection between model calls for custom processing
4. Allow for dynamic prompt adaptation based on context
5. Maintain a comprehensive history of prompt processing steps
6. Facilitate systematic prompt testing and validation

## Key Requirements
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Flexible chaining of prompts and processing functions
- History tracking and management
- Simple API for creating and running prompt chains
- Integration capabilities with major agent frameworks
- Ability to inject custom processing functions between LLM calls
- Options for breaking chains conditionally

## Success Criteria
- Successfully build prompts that can be specialized for different agent frameworks
- Enable dynamic prompt adaptation based on context
- Provide consistent prompt quality across different frameworks
- Allow reusable prompt templates for similar tasks
- Support systematic prompt testing and validation
- Maintain a simple, developer-friendly API

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Core prompt chaining functionality
- Multiple model support
- Function injection capabilities
- History tracking
- Integration examples with agent frameworks
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Basic error handling and logging

### Out of Scope
